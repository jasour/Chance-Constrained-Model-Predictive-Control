Convex Chance Constrained Model Predictive Control For Probabilistic Polynomial Systems

**Description:**

We consider the Chance Constrained Model Predictive Control problem for polynomial systems subject to disturbances. In this problem, we aim at finding optimal control input for given disturbed dynamical system to minimize a given cost function subject to probabilistic
constraints, over a finite horizon.


**These are working notes and codes and will be updated.**
